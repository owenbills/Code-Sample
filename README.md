# Code-Sample
The file main.c is a sample of my Pololu Zumo project. The code utilizes a header file called zumo_drivers.h which contains some of the functions used to control the Pololu Zumo device. The main functions of this file are to utilize the device's proximity sensors to drive forward and detect objects, remembering the number of obstacles it detects and turning away from objects in its path until a given number of objects have been found, at which point the robot spins in place and the process is completed. Throughout this, the OLED screen on the device displays important information, such as the number of objects that have been found and are remaining.
